### Instructions Clarity:
Excellent


### Layout - Overall Layout:
Excellent


### Layout - Views (2.00 / 4, please pay attention):
- More views are needed in this web:
* "Store" cards in the customer's home page need to be clickable and direct to
store's pages.
* "Shoppers stats" cards in store's home page need to be clickable:
Please design a new page to show customers in the queue and link the
"Current Queue" card to this page.
Please design a new page to show total customers of this store and link the
"Total Shoppers" card to this page.
(What's the meaning of the "Total Shoppers"? All customers including those in
history or all current customers in the store? Please make it explicit)
* "User Stats" cards in the admin home page need to be clickable. Same as above,
link those cards to pages to actually show "online users", "end users", "shop owners".
(What's the meaning of the "end users"? Please make it explicit)
* Need to design pages for "REPLY" messages in admin

- "Contact Us" at the bottom in the admin index page doesn't make sense. Please
remove it. Also, consider rename it as "Contact Admin" since it's misleading in
store's home page
- Need "bottom border" in CSS to separate each store's information shown right
side on the map


### Usability - User Interactions (4.50 / 6):
- Function to delete/block users is needed for admin
- Function to delete/block shop owners is needed for admin
- There is no function for customers to add favourite stores. Please fix that.
- "Notification setting" in the customer's profile seems a "lonely island"
without connection to any other parts of this app. Please build other features
to make good use of it.
- "Back" buttons are needed in "add to queue" also "edit booking" pages
- When zooming in on "/profile", left side navbar overlaps and hides parts of
the right content. Please fix that.


### Server call indicators:
Excellent


### Data (1.50 / 3):
- Hardcoded "average wait time" in the store's home page didn't explicitly show
how it was calculated. Please also add algorithms to calculate that in phase2.
- More elements in the store's profile are needed to show more information of a
store. Please think about it.


### User Benefit:
Excellent


### Project Complexity (though no deduction of marks, please pay attention):
Compared to the proposal, the great progress you've made in phase 1 is worth
praising, so you got full marks in complexity. But that doesn't mean this
project is complex enough. Please refer to the comments above and complete views,
features, and functions mentioned there. Otherwise, you will highly likely lose
marks for complexity in phase2


### Code Organization:
Excellent


*Overall, you did a good job, and there is still a lot of space for you to make progress!*
